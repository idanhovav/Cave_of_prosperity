# Cave_of_prosperity
A tough question, let's find an answer!

Directory:
Python file is the script itself.
Inputs in “in”. Outputs in “out”.
Text file is actually a .java file. It was my first try at this problem a few months ago.


The subreddit daily programmer is great! It’s actually where I got this question from.
The explanation it gives of the problem is pretty spot on, so I’ll just link it here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3aewlg/20150617_challenge_219_hard_the_cave_of_prosperity/

There are also some other interesting solutions to the question in the comments. Another bonus: there are a bunch of different languages represented in the answers!

But, back to my repo: I tried to solve this problem over the summer in Java, and failed miserably. I got to using a 3D array to store, ah I don’t even know anymore. But point is it crashed and died and it died so bad that I also lost the ability to open or run it in eclipse. So the text file is the original source code, but I promise that it should be .java.

The inputs and outputs are based on the instructions given on the subreddit.

All of this code was written by me, Idan Hovav, 14 December 2015.


I should be studying for finals. I have no idea how to use data bricks.
